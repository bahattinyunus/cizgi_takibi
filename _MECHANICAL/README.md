# Mechanical Design: The Chassis

Dynamics and physical optimization for line-following robots.

## Chassis Geometry
- **Short Wheelbase**: Faster rotation but less stable.
- **Long Wheelbase**: More stable but slower at sharp turns.

## Design Tips
- **Weight Distribution**: Keep the battery as low as possible.
- **Wheel Grip**: Use silicone or specialized racing tires for maximum friction.
- **Sensor Distance**: The distance between the front sensor array and the wheels affects the "look-ahead" distance.

## CAD/3D Modeling
- `CHASSIS_V1.stl`: Official competition chassis.
- `SENSOR_MOUNT.step`: Adjustable array mount.
